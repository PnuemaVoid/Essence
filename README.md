A custom scripting language for dialogue, made with and for Godot.

A few weeks ago, I started working on a rapid data entry tool for dialogue.
The tool was meant to help cut down the amount of time necessary to enter dialogue data for visual novels and story-driven games.
Although the tool was fine for the first few builds, it was lacking in terms of what you could do with it.
And so I added more fields . . . But this then led to the workspace feeling too busy, making me wish for something a bit more liberating.
It was then when I came across this Hyperbolica devlog, in which CodeParade showed off his custom scripting language for dialogue.
And it was exactly what I was looking for.
So I set out to create something similar, suited for my needs.
